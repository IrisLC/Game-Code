#Game Design Class

This is code created for a class I took at Miami University (CSE 389 Game Design and Implementation).

Much of this class had us following along with demonstrations and largely copying code OR having guided labs where we were pointed in the right direction for how ot implement various aspects.

Attached are examples of projects where I used a lot of my own knowledge and/or spent a lot of time learning about the aspects of how to create what I wanted to.
