# Game Code
Repositories of code I have written for game projects. 

These folders are collections of files that I have either written the entirety of, or a majority of. This does not include code I have added to team mate's files, nor bug fixing I may have done for them.

Few of these are complete projects, and as such will not run as is, as they require and communicate with other files that I did not make. This is purely a look at the code I write and how I write it for potential employers to look at.
